# TO-DO-07 : Configure JPA
#
#   -   Define properties to make Spring Boot to run SQL
#       scripts located under 'rewards.testdb' directory
spring.datasource.data=rewards/testdb/data.sql
spring.datasource.schema=rewards/testdb/schema.sql

#   -   Define Spring Boot properties to make JPA show
#       the SQL it is running nicely formatted
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true

#   -   Define a Spring Boot property to prevent hibernate
#       running DDL automatically - the scripts already setup
#       the database, we don't need hibernate to do it.
#       (The property you need was in the slides).
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none

#   -   Run RewardNetworkTests. Verify it succeeds.
#       (If you are using Gradle, comment out test exclude
#        statement from the build.gradle before running the test.)
